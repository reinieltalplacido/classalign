# 📚 ClassAlign

**ClassAlign** is a clean, personal class scheduling tool built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Supabase** — designed for teachers, department members, or anyone needing a smart way to organize their weekly classroom schedules.

It combines manual scheduling with AI-powered suggestions using OpenRouter, helping users avoid time conflicts and plan smarter.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently **under active development**.  
> I created this so that anyone — especially students, teachers, or school staff — can easily manage their class schedules without the usual hassle.

More features and polish are coming soon!
